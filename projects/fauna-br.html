                        Fauna Brasil was incredible designed by Bruno Mezzomo, and I developed it with OpenCart3, and used shared hosting to share it.
                    </p>
                    <p>How is the development process?</p>
                    <p>
                        First, I received the wireframes, prototypes and source from Bruno.
                        Then, I have instaled OpenCart3, and start coding the front-end.
                        After the front-end, I installed the shipping and payment plugins, and created some to give freedom
                        to the admin to change stuff on front-end without a code change.
                    </p>
                    <p>What type of changes?</p>
                    <p>
                        Just like the main banner photos, the highlights and the partners, on partners section.
                        All of this is customized on the OpenCart dashboard.
